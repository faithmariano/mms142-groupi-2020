# Whatâ€™s next for EVs?
All in all, the future looks bright for electronic vehicles especially thanks to the 21st century trend of the electrification of transport.
### The electric car industry 
The driving force of electronic vehicle adoption is the global climate crisis. Pressure from world governments and various organizations are calling upon the mass adoption of EVs. EVs are estimated to comprise 58% of global car sales and represent more than a fourth of all cars on the road in 2040 (Sylvia, 2020).
