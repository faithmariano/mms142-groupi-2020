# Current Impact and Issues of E-Vehicles
**Climate Change**, specifically global warming - which is one of the effects of climate change -- is one of the biggest environmental crises of our time, if not, the biggest. The United Nations (UN) defines it as the rise of global temperatures due to the increasing amount of greenhouse gases it has been trapping and accumulating in the earth's atmosphere. According to the organization, some of its problem's key contributors are the Industrial Revolution, large scale agriculture, and deforestation. (United Nations, 2020) For most of us, this is not an alien concept as we have been taught that it is a chronic environmental illness our generation has been facing and one that future generations will struggle battling if me do not act on it now. As we grow older, we make an effort to fight this problem in our own simple ways like making eco-friendly lifestyle switches such as using menstrual cups instead of sanitary pads, reducing our use of single-use plastic, practicing the 3R's, or even switching to solar power sources. On a larger scale, some industries, in their own ways, have been taking necessary steps to address this global problem. 

The transport and automotive industry’s response to climate change is the manufacturing of electric vehicles, also known as e-vehicles or plug-in vehicles. International car startups like Tesla and manufacturers like BMW, Audi, Chevrolet, Honda, and Hyundai have aligned goals with climate change experts and have come up with their own e-vehicle lines in attempts to reduce carbon emissions. In the Philippines, locals and the national government have been pushing for the use of e-vehicles especially when it comes to public transport. In campuses like Ateneo de Manila University and the University of the Philippines Diliman, e-vehicles like e-jeepneys have also been made available for in-campus shuttle services. They aim to reduce carbon emissions within their grounds. The Department of Energy has also come up with the E-Trike Program with 3 main aims: “(1) to deploy 100,000 e-trikes nationwide to replace the same number of traditional gasoline-fed tricycles; (2) reduce the transport sector’s annual petroleum consumption by 2.8% (equivalent to 89.2 million liters) per year; and (3) achieve 79% carbon dioxide(CO2) footprint avoidance.” (Department of Trade and Industry, n.d.) Globally, this response of the automotive industry just goes to show that many believe in the sustainable positive impact e-vehicles would bring to the table of strategies against climate change.

E-vehicles take pride in the positive environmental impact it has been making and could still make. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) claims that all-electric vehicles produce zero direct emissions, i.e. smog-forming pollutants, greenhouse gases, and other harmful pollutants. In a Forbes article, James Ellsmoor stated that “EVs are responsible for considerably lower emissions over their lifetime than vehicles running on fossil fuels, regardless of the source that generates the electricity.” (Ellsmoor, 2019) In addition to these, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) also has concluded in their 2018 briefing that the typical e-vehicle cuts down greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and is almost 30% cleaner than combustion engine vehicles in terms of their life cycle. Although there are many positive impacts e-vehicles could offer, on the other side of the spectrum, e-vehicles are being scrutinized by skeptics and other environmental groups.

**The main environmental issue with e-vehicles is the amount of carbon emissions during their production stage.** In a BBC article, Tim Schwanen states that e-vehicle production involves substantial amounts of carbon dioxide emissions - from the production of their batteries (i.e. mineral sourcing), dismantling of deteriorated batteries, to the production of the whole car. (Schwanen, 2019) But to counter, in the aforementioned ICCT briefing, it was concluded that the kind of materials needed for the batteries and the location of production plays are factors to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. It was also concluded that the massive amount of emissions during their production stage would be paid off in two years, but they suggested more research be done in this area. The ICCT has also suggested a solution to the destructive impact of e-vehicle battery manufacturing. A 30% grid decarbonization would result to a 17% decrease in battery production emissions, though they suggest more research be done to provide more data and even strategies to further reduce the battery production emissions. E-vehicles bring to the table a lot of positive environmental impacts, and it cannot be denied that it is a greener alternative to combustion engine vehicles -- but of course, we should also strive to improve production and manufacturing conditions to lessen even more our carbon footprint.

Hopefully as this new decade unfolds, greener transport and automotive strategies will be felt from our government more than the private sector in terms of investments, more e-vehicles will be seen on our streets transporting both goods and people, and more charging stations will be built to accommodate the increase in e-vehicles -- for better climate conditions and air quality not only for our generation, but also for the future’s.
