# The ‘Disruptive’ Rise of EVs 





### STATS IN THE PHILIPPINES

In the Philippines, E-tricycles and e-jeepneys dominate the local EV stock by 56% and 38% respectively The Department of Energy(DOE) launched a program called PUV Modernization Programme and with the help of other organizations like ADB, the rise of e-tricycles and e-jeepneys will continue. Seventeen e-jeepney models and 21 e-tricycle models are in the market.

Seven BEVs(battery electric vehicles) and four PHEVs(plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) are available now or will soon be launched in the country. There are 27 electric two-, 24 three-, and 2 electric four-wheeler personal mobility vehicles in the local market that were imported from China.

However, he Philippines lags in EV development in Southeast Asia. So far, a few Senate bills are still pending regarding incentives to potential EV uses. More incentives should be provided to boost the EV industry in the country.

### STATS OUTSIDE THE PHILIPPINES

Nations around the world are now looking for a way to reduce air pollution and considering that electric cars are now coping up with the production cost to manufacture, this will heavily affect the people working in the electric power industry as well as those in the current car industry. The EU is now moving forward in giving policies to increase market uptakes to manufacture EVs and reduce cost moreover to improve the performance to ease consumers of accepting these vehicles and create a market for EVs.
**_“Note that in addition to these policies that are explicitly implemented to provide incentives for EVs, the current rules on energy taxation in the EU provide a clear incentive as well: Directive 2003/96/EC fixes higher minimum tax rates for transport fuels than taxes on electricity, and these are reflected in higher national rates in almost all countries of the EU. In conjunction with the relatively low energy use of EVs (per kilometer), this leads to a much lower energy tax for EVs than for ICEs, per MJ but even more so per kilometer.”_**
