# What are EVs? Quick breakdown and industry history
### What exactly is an EV?
These vehicles’ defining aspects are its **electric motors(s)** that utilizes _stored electric energy_ that drives the automobiles. EVs are not only limited to cars but also spreads to **_rail, air, sea, and even space vehicles_** with the spectrum of three different types of EVs:

## **1. hybrid,** _which combines a traditional engine with some form of electric propulsion,_

## **3. sole rechargeable battery-dependent EVs** _with no internal combustion engine needed._

Though it may sound futuristic, the first ever battery-powered electric vehicle was launched in **1837.** According to _Sanketh (2016),_ **_“By the 1890s, there were actually 10 times as many electric cars sold as gasoline cars. Around 40% of all cars in the US were electric in the first decade of the 20th century.”_**

**What stopped its upsurge?** The now-disruptor had been disrupted before when _early modern assembly lines,_ or more conceptually known as **_mass production,_**
was introduced in **1910** and settled to be the downfall of EVs. Gasoline-powered cars were the first to be put on the lines. Ergo, traditional vehicle manufacturers 
obviously revelled in the significant cost advantage over EV manufacturers. Other contributing factors to its fiasco was a number of discoveries and improvements 
in oil and road infrastructure, while limited EV re-charging infrastructure restricted the range or travel distance of these vehicles _(Sansketh, 2016)._

It has been 3 centuries since electric vehicles were invented and became possible albeit its crude design and inefficiency, with the fast and improving technology
appearing, _EVs are now becoming a true technological innovation that the car industry cannot ignore, with the principal catalyst that is **sustainability.**_ 
Though ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles are still common around the world, some countries are now looking to EVs as an alternative or better replacement 
for traditional vehicles to reduce carbon emissions.
