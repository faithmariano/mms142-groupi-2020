# The ‘Disruptive’ Rise of EVs 


In an article entitled, Electric Vehicles: Are they disruptive?, Ashwin Sanketh, a Portfolio Manager at Nikko Asset Management, briefly discussed how EVs can be considered as a disruptive technology, especially for the next coming years. But what does he mean by disruptive technology? According to the online Cambridge dictionary, disruptive usually refers to or is associated with something negative – causing trouble and therefore stopping something from continuing as usual. However, in business, the outlook on this word is more positive – changing the traditional way that an industry operates, especially in a new and effective way. As Professor Clayton M. Christensen coined the term, he describes disruptive technology as typically simpler, cheaper, more reliable, and more convenient than established technologies.

Based on the definition given by Prof. Christensen, Sanketh explained that as compared to ICE-powered vehicles, EVs are certainly: 

* simpler as it only has one moving part of the motor
* more reliable as it requires less maintenance, and 
* cheaper since it lowers the operation and maintenance costs 

Although some people argued that EVs were not disruptive because it has not addressed the remaining two-thirds of the global car market in 2016, the demand for their units continues to rise. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, an office of the U.S. Department of Energy, stated that EVs do not only provide individual benefits but also economic and environmental benefits. In the U.S., it is believed that EVs can help to have a greater diversity of fuel choices available for transportation. Thus, it reduces the threat of price spikes and supply disruptions by limiting their reliance on petroleum.  In addition, EVs are a huge aid in lessening pollutants and emissions by charging it on renewable energy such as solar and wind. By doing so, it improves public health as well as minimizes its ecological damage.

Despite painful losses, manufacturers continue to form and expand their partnership with other automakers, spending billions for the advancement of this technology. It was reported by Kevin Klemens of Design News, a monthly US trade publication published by UBM Electronics, that although the sales volumes are still small, EVs are still having a large and growing effect on the overall auto industry in 2019. On the other hand,


### STATISTICS IN THE PHILIPPINES

In the Philippines, e-tricycles and e-jeepneys dominate the local EV stock by 56% and 38% respectively. The Department of Energy(DOE) launched a program called PUV Modernization Programme and with the help of other organizations like ADB, the rise of e-tricycles and e-jeepneys will continue. 17 e-jeepney models and 21 e-tricycle models are in the market.

7 BEVs (battery electric vehicles) and 4 PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) are available now and some will soon be launched in the country. There are 27 two-, 24 three-, and 2 four-wheeler electric personal mobility vehicles in the local market that were imported from China.

However, the Philippines falls behind in EV development in Southeast Asia. So far, a few Senate bills are still pending regarding incentives to potential EV uses. More incentives should be provided to boost the EV industry in the country.

### STATISTICS OUTSIDE THE PHILIPPINES

Nations around the world are now looking for a way to reduce air pollution and considering that electric cars are now coping up with the production cost to manufacture, this will heavily affect the people working in the electric power industry as well as those in the current car industry. The EU is now moving forward in giving policies to increase market uptakes to manufacture EVs, and reduce cost moreover to improve the performance to ease consumers of accepting these vehicles and create a market for EVs.
**_“Note that in addition to these policies that are explicitly implemented to provide incentives for EVs, the current rules on energy taxation in the EU provide a clear incentive as well: Directive 2003/96/EC fixes higher minimum tax rates for transport fuels than taxes on electricity, and these are reflected in higher national rates in almost all countries of the EU. In conjunction with the relatively low energy use of EVs (per kilometer), this leads to a much lower energy tax for EVs than for ICEs, per MJ but even more so per kilometer.”_**
